# COM-119, Spring 2023: Course Directory

Here all the lab sources, URI solutions, and projects should be stored and submitted by the student to their private course repository. The repository MUST be shared with the instructor and only with him. The student MUST commit and push to GitHub periodically after finishing work on every lab problem, URI solution, or part of a project. The repository will be checked regularly by the instructor or an automated script and graded. Ensure to keep the directory in good order. Ensure to precisely follow the naming convention for directories, files, and classes. Your grade will be lowered if the naming is incorrect and the autograder fails to test your work. Do not share your work, and don't plagiarize other people's work. Your repository will be checked for plagiarism from time to time. In the case of a severe infraction, you will be reported to the registrar's office and automatically fail the course.

```

### Module Names

### Labs

`Problem<NN>.java` where NN is the problem number with the leading 0 in front if less than one digit is used.

#### Example

Problem01.java
Problem02.java
...
```
